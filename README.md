 # Stock Portfolio Tracker

 This is an web app built with React JS and its objective is to help you track your stock investments. It gives you the option to choose out of a list of popular stocks and enter the data necessary to keep track of them. Once the data has been added it is saved in a table showing you an overview of your portfolio. You also have the posibility to remove any holding data you don't want shown in the table anymore.

 !!! This is a dummy project meant for training and not for commercial purposes. You can still download the project and use it or, if you want, make some changes that you think might make it better.
